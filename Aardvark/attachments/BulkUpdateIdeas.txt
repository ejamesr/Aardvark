For Aardvark to be truly functional, the Admin should be able to quickly populate the Users in the system
via CSV data that can be easily created in Excel.

Adding a user:
=============
Use whichever column headings are desired. Available columns:

Columns:	UserName, DisplayName, FirstName, LastName, 
			Email, EmailConfirmed, PhoneNumber, PhoneNumberConfirmed, 
			TextMsgNumber, SkillLevel, EmailNotificationOk, TextNotificationOk

Rules:
-----
- UserName must be unique, must be present.
- Email should be valid email format.
- PhoneNumber should be valid, any non-digit chars will be stripped out during processing
- Column names ending with "Ok" expect T or Y for true/yes, and F or N for false/no. Case insensitive.
- SkillLevel valid values: Junior, Mid-Level, or Senior. Case insensitive.
- Any column without an entry will be set to a blank value. If no SkillLevel specified, will default to Junior.
- EmailConfirmed and PhoneNumberConfirmed expect T or F. If omitted or F,
	an email and or text will be sent to the number to have it confirmed.
  
  
Adding Roles:
============
Each UserName listed must already be registered in the system. Available columns:

Columns:	UserName, Role1, Role2, Role3, Role4

Rules:
-----
- UserName must be a valid UserName already in the system.
- Valid values for any Role_ column: Admin, ProjectManager, Developer, Submitter. Case insensitive.
- Roles can be listed in any order, in any column. Any empty column will simply be skipped over.
- Roles should not be duplicated.


Adding Projects:
===============
When projects are added, each must be assigned to a valid UserName already in the system with one role being "ProjectManager."

Columns:	UserName, ProjectTitle, ProjectDescription

Rules:
-----
- UserName must be valid.
- UserName must have a role of "ProjectManager"
- Both ProjectTitle and ProjectDescription must have entries. Case sensitive.
