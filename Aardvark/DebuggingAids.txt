List of Methods for Debugging

Can't debug the .cshtml file (won't hit breakpoints)
====================================================
Some people have suggested to Build/Clean Solution, then removing Bin and Obj folders, then closing and restarting Visual Studio

What I've found:
- This issue seems to occur when there is some major bug in the .cshtml file.  Once it is removed, the file can be debugged.
- To test this, comment just about everything except for some small innocuous code, see if that can be debugged.
  - if so, you are on your way!  Just uncomment out a few areas at a time
- Or, see if the model is not correct


When the code crashes when creating 'manager' in UserRolesHelper
================================================================
This almost always means you just changed something in the database; do 'update-database'.

If you make a field [Required] that was not at first (or change/add some other attribute), and there are 
one or more records with a null in that field, the update will abort with an error.  First, put a non-null value
in those fields.  Then to 'update-database'.  Things should work fine after that!


File won't upload, 'fileUpload' var is null on POST
===================================================
First, you need to specify that the form comes in multiple parts; this statement does that:

@* To specify that the form comes in multiple parts: *@
@using (Html.BeginForm("Create", "Posts", FormMethod.Post, new { enctype = "multipart/form-data" }))
{
	...
}

Next, make sure the input element has the name and id set to the value the POST controller expects
(i.e., set them to 'fileUpload').
