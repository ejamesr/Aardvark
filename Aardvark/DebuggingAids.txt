List of Methods for Debugging

Can't debug the .cshtml file (won't hit breakpoints)
====================================================
Some people have suggested to Build/Clean Solution, then removing Bin and Obj folders, then closing and restarting Visual Studio

What I've found:
- This issue seems to occur when there is some major bug in the .cshtml file.  Once it is removed, the file can be debugged.
- To test this, comment just about everything except for some small innocuous code, see if that can be debugged.
  - if so, you are on your way!  Just uncomment out a few areas at a time
- Or, see if the model is not correct
